# API-Map

I used this project to hone my skills with APIs. Using geolocation services, Google Maps, and GitHub, the app displays a map of cities with their corresponding numbers of GitHub users. With this project I also delved deeper into JavaScript promises, Node.js and Herokuâ€™s config variables feature to protect my API keys.
